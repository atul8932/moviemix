      <h1>Cancellation Policy</h1>
      <p>
        At <span className="highlight">MovieHub</span>, we aim to provide a smooth
        and transparent process for our users. Since our platform primarily deals
        with digital movie content access, cancellations are subject to certain rules.

      <ul>
        <li>
          Once a payment is successfully completed, <strong>cancellation is not
          applicable</strong> as digital movie content access is instantly
          initiated.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you believe your payment was processed by mistake or without consent,
          please contact our support team within <strong>24 hours</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          In case of double payment due to a technical error, you will be eligible
          for a full refund of the duplicate transaction.
