      Whenever I request code or a change:
      1. **First**, create a **Code Changes Documentation (CCD)** in Markdown with:
         - **Files Affected:** List of file paths impacted.
         - **New Functions/Components:** Summaries of newly added code blocks.
         - **Modified Functions/Components:** What was changed and why.
         - **Removed/Deprecated Code (if any):** With reasons for removal.
         - **Example Usage or Impact:** How this change affects existing logic or usage.
      2. **Then**, provide the actual code implementation in a separate block.
      3. Keep **CCD** and **code** clearly separated for easy review.
